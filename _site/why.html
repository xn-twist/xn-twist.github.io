<p>The word “why” can be used to ask many different things… in this case, I’m going to answer two of the most common usages of the word. First, why does XN-Twist exist in the sense of: <em>what is the cause and motivation that started XN-Twist?</em> Second, why does XN-Twist exist in the sense of: <em>what is/are the goal(s) of the XN-Twist project?</em></p>

<p>To answer the first question, the XN-Twist project came about I found an internationalized domain being used as part of a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> campaign for the first time. I hadn’t heard of internationalized domains before this time and I was shocked that these domains where not being used more often. As I began to investigate further, it quickly became apparent that internationalized domains posed a bit of a one-way problem. It is very easy, given an internationalized domain spoofing a legitimate domain, to identify what the internationalized domain name is trying to spoof, but it is very difficult to work in the other direction (finding the possible internationalized domain squats of a given domain name).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Easy: internationalized domain spoof ==&gt; legitimate domain name
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hard: potential internationalized domain spoofs &lt;== legitimate domain name
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Thus, this project began when I realized that most organizations only have the capability to <em>react</em> to internationalized domain squats rather than proactively identifying, monitoring, and registering potentially dangerous domains.</p>

<p>The answer to the second question, regarding the goal(s) of the XN-Twist project, follows from the problem described above. The goal of the XN-Twist project is to provide individuals and organizations with a means of proactively identifying internationalized domain squats.</p>
